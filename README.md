Understanding audience expertise helps you know how much detail to go into. For tech experts, you can use specific terms, while for regular folks, you’d simplify things and avoid heavy jargon.

Tailoring content means adjusting your language and examples. For tech experts, go deep into the details. For regular folks, use relatable analogies, simple language, and avoid complex terms.

Gauging existing knowledge can be done by asking questions, conducting surveys, or checking what kind of questions they ask. You can also start with basics and build up to see their comfort level.

Making content accessible includes using simple words, breaking down ideas step-by-step, and explaining technical terms when you do need them.

Plain language is important because it makes things clear and easy to understand for everyone, even those who aren’t familiar with the topic. Jargon can confuse people.

Simplifying terms (like "start" instead of "initiate") makes it easier for everyone to understand. It removes unnecessary complexity and helps with clearer communication.

Examples and visuals make complex ideas less abstract and more concrete. They give a real-world context and make it easier to grasp difficult concepts.

Effective visuals depend on the information. Diagrams and flowcharts work well for processes, while bar or line charts help with data trends.

Headings and subheadings break up content into sections, making it easier to scan. They guide the reader and help find important info faster.

Best practices for headings: Keep them clear and specific, use a logical hierarchy (e.g., main heading, subheading, sub-subheading), and make sure they give a quick idea of what the section is about.

Readme introduction should include a brief description of what the product does, why it’s useful, and any key features or functionality.

Conveying purpose and features briefly: Describe what the product does, who it’s for, and highlight the main features without getting too technical.
